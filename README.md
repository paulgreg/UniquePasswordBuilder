# UniquePasswordBuilder

UniquePasswordBuilder is a tool to help you generate strong and different password for each site you visit.
From your master password (a strong password that you use), a password is generated using an hashing algorithm and the domainâ€™s URL.
Scrypt is used to hash the password.

Check [the home page for further details](http://paulgreg.me/UniquePasswordBuilder).

UniquePasswordBuilder is available via 3 tools :

  * a [web page](http://paulgreg.me/UniquePasswordBuilder),
  * a [bookmarklet](http://paulgreg.me/UniquePasswordBuilder),
  * a [Firefox Add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/uniquepasswordbuilder-addon).


## Build the webpage and the bookmarklet

Launch `npm install` then launch `gulp` which will concatenate and uglify JS files.

## Build the Addon

Gulp generates files (data/upb-main.min.js) which are copied into the data directory.
So be sure to launch `gulp` the first time and each time you change JS source files.
