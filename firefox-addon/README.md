Description
===========

This is the UniquePasswordBuilder add-on for Firefox, helping you generate a strong and different password for each website you want to login while still typing the same password (which I call the master password) everywhere.
Youâ€™ll find more information on [UniquePasswordBuilder homepage](https://paulgreg.me/UniquePasswordBuilder/).

It uses the [Web Extension API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions) which should make it easier to port it to Google Chrome.
